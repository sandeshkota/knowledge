### TOGAF training levels
- TOGAF Foundation training
- TOGAF Certification training

### TOGAF architecture areas
- Business architecture
- Data architecture
- Applications architecture
- Technical architecture

### Steps in Order
Ref models, VPs, tools > Dev baseline BA > Dev Target BA > Gap Analysis > Roadmap > Resolve Impacts > Stakeholder Rev > Finalize BA > Create ADD

### TOGAF components
- ADM: Architecture Development Method - How to create architecture
-  Architecture Content Framework - Structure all artifacts, catalog and matricies that are produced by ADM
-  Architecture Capability Framework - How do you produce architectural capabilities - Structured definition of organization's skills, roles and responsibilities to establish amd operate an enterprise architecture
-  ADM guideliness and techniques
-  Enterprise continum - A model for structuring a virtual repository and methods for classifying architecture and solution artifcats


### ADM
- Preliminary: understand business environment, high level management commitment, agreement on scope, establish principles and governance structure
- Architecture Vision: Sets scope, constraints and expectations (creates a vision, validates business context)
- Business Architecture: Business process and people, their relationship (shows how organization meets its goals)
  - Organization structure
  - Busienss goals and objectives 
  - Business functions
  - Business services
  - Business processes
  - Business roels
  - Business data models
  - Corelation of organization and functions
  - Steps
    - select reference models, viewpoints and tools
    - define baseline architecture description
    - define target architecture description
    - Perform gap analysis
    - define candidate roadmap components
    - Conduct stake holder review
    - Finalize the architecture
  - Architectural Diagram is defined
- Systems architecture
  - major types of informationa nd applications to process them
  - relationship to each other and the environment, and the principles governing it's design and evolution
- Information Systems architecture: data or applciation first ?
  - theory suggests data architecture first
  - practical considerations may mean that starting with application architecture may be more effecient
- Technology Architecture: organization of an IT system
  - hardware, software and communications technology
  - relationships to each other and the environment
  - principles governing its design and evolution
- Opportunities & Solution: Initial implementation planning, decide on approach (make v/s buy v/s reuse)(outsource)(COTS - Commercial of the shelf)(opensource)
- Migration Planning: Cost/Benefit analysis, Risk assesment
- Implementation Governance: provide arch oversight for the implementation, define arch cosntraints on implementation projects, govern and manage arch contract, monitors implementaion work for conformance, produce business value realization
- Architecture Change Management: provide continual monitoring and change management process, ensure the changes to arch are managed in a cohesive and architected way,  estalishes and supports enterprise architecture to provide flexibility to evolve rapidly in response to changes in technology or business environment, monitor the business and capacity management
