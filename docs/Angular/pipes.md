### What are Pipes ?
Pipes in ANgular are used to transform data from one format to another while rendering. Pipes doesn't change the actual value and instead only change the value/format for just showing it to users (in HTML).

### What are Parameterized Pipes ?

### Pure v/s Impure Pipe ?
Pure Pipe is called when Angular detects a change in the value or the parameters passed to a pipe.
Impure Pipe is called for every change detection cycle no matter whether the value or the parameters passed changes.
